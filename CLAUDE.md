# Cold Email System - Complete Implementation

## 🚀 System Overview
This is a fully automated pipeline that synchronizes lead data between BigQuery and Instantly.ai for cold email campaigns. The system handles lead segmentation, campaign management, sequence tracking, and automated lead lifecycle management.

## 🎯 Current Status: **PRODUCTION READY**
- ✅ **292,561 eligible leads** ready for processing
- ✅ **Dual GitHub Actions workflows** (sync every 30 min, drain every 2 hours)
- ✅ **Smart segmentation** (SMB < $1M, Midsize ≥ $1M)
- ✅ **90-day cooldown system** prevents lead fatigue
- ✅ **11,726 DNC entries** for compliance
- ✅ **Email verification system** using Instantly API (filters invalid emails)
- ✅ **Comprehensive error tracking** and logging
- ✅ **Campaigns ACTIVE** - both SMB and Midsize campaigns running
- ⚠️ **Schedule configuration needed** - campaigns active but no sending days configured

## 🔄 How It Works

### **Dual-Workflow Architecture**

#### **Main Sync Workflow (Every 30 Minutes)**
- **Phase 1: TOP-UP** - Adds new verified leads to campaigns
- **Phase 2: HOUSEKEEPING** - Updates tracking and reports metrics
- **Runs:** Every 30 minutes during business hours (9 AM - 6 PM EST, Mon-Fri)
- **Weekend schedule:** Every 2 hours

#### **Dedicated Drain Workflow (Every 2 Hours)**  
- **Intelligent Lead Classification:** Uses working POST `/api/v2/leads/list` endpoint
- **Smart Decision Logic:** 8 scenarios including OOO handling, bounce grace periods
- **Removes finished leads** to free inventory space (replied, completed, unsubscribed, stale)
- **Trusts Instantly's OOO filtering** (stop_on_auto_reply=false configuration)
- **Grace periods:** 7-day grace for hard bounces, keeps soft bounces for retry
- **Automatic DNC management** for unsubscribes with enhanced tracking
- **Enhanced BigQuery updates** with detailed drain reasons and history
- **Runs:** Every 2 hours during business hours, every 4 hours weekends

#### **Main Sync: TOP-UP Process**
- Queries BigQuery for fresh eligible leads (default: 100 per run)
- **Immediate Lead Creation:** Creates leads directly in Instantly campaigns (no blocking)
- **Simple Async Verification:** Triggers lightweight verification system for created leads
- **Smart Segmentation:**
  - SMB: Revenue < $1,000,000 → Campaign `8c46e0c9-c1f9-4201-a8d6-6221bafeada6`
  - Midsize: Revenue ≥ $1,000,000 → Campaign `5ffbe8c3-dc0e-41e4-9999-48f00d2015df`
- Creates leads with company data, async verification system handles email validation
- Respects 24,000 lead inventory cap

#### **Async Verification Workflow (Every 5 Minutes)**
- **Simple Polling System:** Checks pending verification results from Instantly API
- **Critical Safeguards:** 24-hour duplicate guard, respects DRY_RUN mode
- **Efficient Deletion:** Uses instantly_lead_id for fast removal of invalid emails
- **DNC Management:** Automatically adds invalid emails to Do Not Contact list
- **Error Resilience:** Treats 404 on deletion as success (idempotent operations)

#### **Main Sync: HOUSEKEEPING Process**
- Updates ops tracking tables
- Logs performance metrics and system health
- Reports summary statistics
- Manages error logging

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **Modular Shared Components**
The system now uses a shared component architecture:
- **`shared/api_client.py`** - Centralized Instantly API operations
- **`shared/bigquery_utils.py`** - BigQuery connection and query management  
- **`shared/models.py`** - Data models and type definitions

### **BigQuery Tables Created**
```sql
-- Current campaign state tracking with email verification
ops_inst_state (email, campaign_id, status, instantly_lead_id, added_at, updated_at,
               verification_status, verification_catch_all, verification_credits_used, verified_at)

-- 90-day cooldown tracking  
ops_lead_history (email, campaign_id, sequence_name, status_final, completed_at, attempt_num)

-- Failed operation logging
ops_dead_letters (id, occurred_at, phase, email, http_status, error_text, retry_count)

-- Dynamic configuration
config (key, value_int, value_string, updated_at)

-- Smart filtering view
v_ready_for_instantly -- Combines all filtering logic
```

### **Key Features**

- **DNC Protection:** Permanent unsubscribe list with enhanced tracking (11,726+ entries)  
- **Inventory Management:** Automatic lead lifecycle management prevents cap issues
- **Error Tracking:** Dead letter logging for all failures with conservative fallbacks
- **Smart Filtering:** Excludes duplicates, active leads, and recent completions
- **Adaptive Rate Limiting:** Intelligent API throttling based on response patterns
- **Verification Safeguards:** 24-hour duplicate guard, efficient deletion, DNC automation

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **"No leads showing in campaigns"**
- **Cause:** Schedule not configured (Active days: NONE)
- **Solution:** Configure sending schedule in Instantly dashboard
  1. Go to each campaign settings
  2. Set active sending days (Monday-Friday recommended)
  3. Set sending hours (9 AM - 6 PM EST)
  4. Set timezone (America/New_York)
- **Note:** Campaigns are ACTIVE but need sending schedule configuration

#### **"GitHub Actions failing"**
- **Check:** Secrets are properly configured
- **Debug:** Review workflow logs for specific error messages  
- **Validate:** Run `validate_environment.py` locally

#### **"API 401 errors"**
- **Cause:** Missing or invalid INSTANTLY_API_KEY
- **Solution:** Verify secret is set correctly in GitHub
- **Test:** Script now includes fallback to config file for local testing

#### **"Async verification not triggering"**
- **Check:** Look for "Async verification system loaded" or "not available" messages in logs
- **Debug:** Verify `async_email_verification.py` module is present and importable
- **Solution:** If module missing, system falls back to Instantly's internal validation only

#### **"Verification credits being consumed"**
- **Expected:** Async verification uses Instantly API credits for each verification attempt
- **Monitor:** Check verification statistics in BigQuery ops_inst_state table
- **Control:** If needed, async verification can be disabled by removing the module

#### **"Leads not being drained properly"**
- **Check API:** Verify POST `/api/v2/leads/list` endpoint is working
- **Debug:** Use "Drain activity analysis" query above to see drain reasons
- **Common causes:** Campaign IDs changed, API key issues, classification logic errors
- **Solution:** Check drain functionality logs for classification details

#### **"OOO responses being counted as replies"**
- **System behavior:** Now trusts Instantly's built-in OOO detection
- **Configuration:** stop_on_auto_reply=false (correctly configured)  
- **Verification:** Check if leads with OOO responses remain active (not drained)
- **Expected:** Only genuine replies (Status 3 + reply_count > 0) should be drained as "replied"

#### **"Inventory still growing toward cap"**
- **Root cause:** Drain functionality was previously disabled (returned empty list)
- **Status:** ✅ Now fixed with working API integration and classification
- **Monitor:** Use ops_inst_state status breakdown query to track drain activity
- **Expected:** Should see 'completed', 'replied', 'unsubscribed' statuses in drain analysis

#### **"Leads being deleted too quickly after failures"**
- **Previous issue:** Single failure would trigger immediate lead deletion
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed with graduated failure handling
- **New behavior:** Leads get 3 attempts before deletion (tracked in ops_dead_letters)
- **Monitor:** Check dead letters table for retry attempts before deletion

#### **"System crashing on malformed data"**
- **Previous issue:** PARSE_TIMESTAMP errors would crash the system
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed with SAFE.PARSE_TIMESTAMP implementation  
- **New behavior:** Malformed timestamps return NULL instead of causing crashes
- **Monitor:** Review logs for timestamp parsing warnings

#### **"Rate limiting causing excessive delays"**
- **Previous issue:** Fixed delays regardless of API performance
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed with AdaptiveRateLimit system
- **New behavior:** Delays adjust based on success/failure patterns (0.5s-10s range)
- **Monitor:** Look for "Rate limit optimized" or "Rate limit increased" debug messages

### **New Diagnostic Tools**

#### **"System health check needed"**
- **Solution:** Use new BigQuery Diagnostics workflow
- **Access:** Manual trigger in GitHub Actions with verbose option
- **Capabilities:** Permission validation, table structure verification, connectivity testing

#### **"Verification polling too slow"**
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed - Now polls every 5 minutes during business hours
- **Previous:** Every 15 minutes
- **Benefit:** Faster lead processing and quicker invalid email removal
