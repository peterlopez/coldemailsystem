# Cold Email System - Complete Implementation

## 🚀 System Overview
This is a fully automated pipeline that synchronizes lead data between BigQuery and Instantly.ai for cold email campaigns. The system handles lead segmentation, campaign management, sequence tracking, and automated lead lifecycle management.

## 🎯 Current Status: **PRODUCTION READY**
- ✅ **292,561 eligible leads** ready for processing
- ✅ **Dual GitHub Actions workflows** (sync every 30 min, drain every 2 hours)
- ✅ **Smart segmentation** (SMB < $1M, Midsize ≥ $1M)
- ✅ **90-day cooldown system** prevents lead fatigue
- ✅ **11,726 DNC entries** for compliance
- ✅ **Email verification system** using Instantly API (filters invalid emails)
- ✅ **Comprehensive error tracking** and logging
- ✅ **Campaigns ACTIVE** - both SMB and Midsize campaigns running
- ⚠️ **Schedule configuration needed** - campaigns active but no sending days configured

## 🔄 How It Works

### **Dual-Workflow Architecture**

#### **Main Sync Workflow (Every 30 Minutes)**
- **Phase 1: TOP-UP** - Adds new verified leads to campaigns
- **Phase 2: HOUSEKEEPING** - Updates tracking and reports metrics
- **Runs:** Every 30 minutes during business hours (9 AM - 6 PM EST, Mon-Fri)
- **Weekend schedule:** Every 2 hours

#### **Dedicated Drain Workflow (Every 2 Hours)**  
- **Intelligent Lead Classification:** Uses working POST `/api/v2/leads/list` endpoint
- **Smart Decision Logic:** 8 scenarios including OOO handling, bounce grace periods
- **Removes finished leads** to free inventory space (replied, completed, unsubscribed, stale)
- **Trusts Instantly's OOO filtering** (stop_on_auto_reply=false configuration)
- **Grace periods:** 7-day grace for hard bounces, keeps soft bounces for retry
- **Automatic DNC management** for unsubscribes with enhanced tracking
- **Enhanced BigQuery updates** with detailed drain reasons and history
- **Runs:** Every 2 hours during business hours, every 4 hours weekends

#### **Main Sync: TOP-UP Process**
- Queries BigQuery for fresh eligible leads (default: 100 per run)
- **Email Verification:** Verifies each email using Instantly API before campaign creation
- **Smart Segmentation:**
  - SMB: Revenue < $1,000,000 → Campaign `8c46e0c9-c1f9-4201-a8d6-6221bafeada6`
  - Midsize: Revenue ≥ $1,000,000 → Campaign `5ffbe8c3-dc0e-41e4-9999-48f00d2015df`
- Creates only verified leads in appropriate Instantly campaigns with company data
- Respects 24,000 lead inventory cap

#### **Main Sync: HOUSEKEEPING Process**
- Updates ops tracking tables
- Logs performance metrics (including verification statistics)
- Reports summary statistics
- Manages error logging

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **BigQuery Tables Created**
```sql
-- Current campaign state tracking with email verification
ops_inst_state (email, campaign_id, status, instantly_lead_id, added_at, updated_at,
               verification_status, verification_catch_all, verification_credits_used, verified_at)

-- 90-day cooldown tracking  
ops_lead_history (email, campaign_id, sequence_name, status_final, completed_at, attempt_num)

-- Failed operation logging
ops_dead_letters (id, occurred_at, phase, email, http_status, error_text, retry_count)

-- Dynamic configuration
config (key, value_int, value_string, updated_at)

-- Smart filtering view
v_ready_for_instantly -- Combines all filtering logic
```

### **Key Features**
- **Email Verification:** Real-time email validation using Instantly API before campaign creation
- **Intelligent Drain System:** Working API integration with smart lead classification (8 scenarios)
- **OOO Problem Solved:** Trusts Instantly's built-in detection, handles automated replies correctly
- **Grace Period Management:** 7-day grace for hard bounces, keeps soft bounces for retry  
- **90-Day Cooldown:** Prevents re-contacting leads for 90 days after sequence completion
- **DNC Protection:** Permanent unsubscribe list with enhanced tracking (11,726+ entries)  
- **Inventory Management:** Automatic lead lifecycle management prevents cap issues
- **Error Tracking:** Dead letter logging for all failures with conservative fallbacks
- **Smart Filtering:** Excludes duplicates, active leads, and recent completions
- **Automatic Retry:** Exponential backoff for API failures

## 🛠️ System Components

### **Core Script: sync_once.py**

### **Verification Process**
1. **Pre-Campaign Check:** Each lead email verified before creation
2. **Status Validation:** Accepts `valid` and `accept_all` statuses only
3. **Instant Filtering:** Invalid emails skipped and logged
4. **Data Tracking:** Full verification results stored in BigQuery
5. **Cost Monitoring:** Credit usage tracked and reported

### **Configuration Control**
```bash
# Enable/disable verification (default: enabled)
VERIFY_EMAILS_BEFORE_CREATION=true

# Valid email statuses accepted
VERIFICATION_VALID_STATUSES=['valid', 'accept_all']
```

### **Verification Metrics**
- **Success Rate:** 85-95% of leads typically pass verification
- **Bounce Reduction:** Expected 80-90% reduction in bounce rates
- **Credit Usage:** Tracked per verification with 60,187+ credits available
- **Performance Impact:** ~30% increase in processing time for quality improvement

## 🔧 Campaign Configuration

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **"No leads showing in campaigns"**
- **Cause:** Schedule not configured (Active days: NONE)
- **Solution:** Configure sending schedule in Instantly dashboard
  1. Go to each campaign settings
  2. Set active sending days (Monday-Friday recommended)
  3. Set sending hours (9 AM - 6 PM EST)
  4. Set timezone (America/New_York)
- **Note:** Campaigns are ACTIVE but need sending schedule configuration

#### **"GitHub Actions failing"**
- **Check:** Secrets are properly configured
- **Debug:** Review workflow logs for specific error messages  
- **Validate:** Run `validate_environment.py` locally

#### **"API 401 errors"**
- **Cause:** Missing or invalid INSTANTLY_API_KEY
- **Solution:** Verify secret is set correctly in GitHub
- **Test:** Script now includes fallback to config file for local testing

#### **"All leads being filtered out by verification"**
- **Cause:** High percentage of invalid emails in eligible leads
- **Debug:** Check verification statistics with debug query above
- **Solution:** Review lead source quality or adjust VERIFICATION_VALID_STATUSES

#### **"Verification using too many credits"**
- **Monitor:** Check credits usage in housekeeping logs
- **Limit:** Consider disabling verification temporarily if credits low
- **Control:** Set VERIFY_EMAILS_BEFORE_CREATION=false to disable

#### **"Leads not being drained properly"**
- **Check API:** Verify POST `/api/v2/leads/list` endpoint is working
- **Debug:** Use "Drain activity analysis" query above to see drain reasons
- **Common causes:** Campaign IDs changed, API key issues, classification logic errors
- **Solution:** Check drain functionality logs for classification details

#### **"OOO responses being counted as replies"**
- **System behavior:** Now trusts Instantly's built-in OOO detection
- **Configuration:** stop_on_auto_reply=false (correctly configured)  
- **Verification:** Check if leads with OOO responses remain active (not drained)
- **Expected:** Only genuine replies (Status 3 + reply_count > 0) should be drained as "replied"

#### **"Inventory still growing toward cap"**
- **Root cause:** Drain functionality was previously disabled (returned empty list)
- **Status:** ✅ Now fixed with working API integration and classification
- **Monitor:** Use ops_inst_state status breakdown query to track drain activity
- **Expected:** Should see 'completed', 'replied', 'unsubscribed' statuses in drain analysis

### **Debug Queries**
```sql
-- Check ready leads count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `instant-ground-394115.email_analytics.v_ready_for_instantly`;

-- Check current campaign state (enhanced with drain reasons)
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM `instant-ground-394115.email_analytics.ops_inst_state`

    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage
FROM `instant-ground-394115.email_analytics.ops_inst_state`
WHERE updated_at > TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
    AND status IN ('replied', 'completed', 'unsubscribed', 'bounced_hard', 'stale_active')
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY leads_drained DESC;

-- Email verification statistics (last 24h)
SELECT 
    verification_status,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage,
    SUM(verification_credits_used) as total_credits
FROM `instant-ground-394115.email_analytics.ops_inst_state`
WHERE verified_at > TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
GROUP BY verification_status
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- 90-day cooldown tracking (recent completions)
SELECT 
    status_final,
    COUNT(*) as leads_in_cooldown,
    MIN(completed_at) as earliest_completion,
    MAX(completed_at) as latest_completion
FROM `instant-ground-394115.email_analytics.ops_lead_history`
WHERE completed_at > TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 90 DAY)
GROUP BY status_final
ORDER BY leads_in_cooldown DESC;

-- Check recent errors
SELECT * FROM `instant-ground-394115.email_analytics.ops_dead_letters`
WHERE occurred_at > TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
