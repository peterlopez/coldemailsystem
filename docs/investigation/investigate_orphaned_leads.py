Investigate Orphaned Leads in Instantly.ai

This script helps identify leads that were created but not properly assigned to campaigns.
Based on the issue where sync reported processing 100 leads but campaigns only show 20.

Key Investigation Areas:
1. Total lead count across all campaigns vs. account total
2. Leads that exist but aren't in any campaign
3. Recently created leads without campaign assignment
4. Verification status of unassigned leads

API Endpoints Used:
- POST /api/v2/leads/list (with and without campaign_id filter)
- GET /api/v2/leads/{id} (for individual lead details)
- GET /api/v2/campaigns (to get all campaigns)
