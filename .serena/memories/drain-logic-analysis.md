# Drain Logic Analysis - Production Readiness Check

## Leads Deleted in Test Run
1. kontakt@celore.pl - completed
2. info@newera.com.ar - completed  
3. info@vlitairemode.nl - completed
4. support@zumimi.net - completed
5. support@asissu.store - completed

All 5 leads were marked as "completed" status for drain.

## Current Classification Logic (from classify_lead_for_drain function)

### Status 3 = Processed/Finished Leads
```python
if status == 3:
    if email_reply_count > 0:
        return 'replied'  # Genuine engagement - drain and add to cooldown
    else:
        return 'completed'  # Sequence completed without replies - drain and add to cooldown
```

### Other Drain Reasons
- Hard bounces after 7-day grace: `bounced_hard`
- Unsubscribes: `unsubscribed` (permanent DNC)
- Stale active (90+ days old): `stale_active`
- Soft bounces: kept for retry (not drained)

## Questions to Verify
1. Are Status 3 leads actually finished sequences?
2. Should we drain leads that completed without replies?
3. Is our OOO handling working (trusting Instantly's filtering)?
4. Are we missing any other statuses that should be drained?
